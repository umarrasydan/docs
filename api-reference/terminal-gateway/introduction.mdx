# Terminal Gateway

Xendit Terminal Gateway enables you to integrate secure payment processing directly into your applications. Connect to physical payment terminals and process transactions seamlessly across multiple platforms with our comprehensive SDKs and APIs.

## What you can do with Terminal Gateway

Terminal Gateway provides everything you need to build in-person payment experiences:

- **Process payments** across multiple channels and payment methods
- **Manage payment sessions** and track transaction status in real-time
- **Handle callbacks** and notifications for payment events
- **Support multiple platforms** including Android, iOS, and web applications
- **Connect to physical terminals** from various providers (BRI, GHL, and more)

<Info>
Terminal Gateway works alongside the Terminal API to provide a complete in-person payment solution. You'll use the Terminal API to create payment sessions and the Terminal Gateway SDKs to interact with physical payment devices.
