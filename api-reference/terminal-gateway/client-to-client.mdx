description: 'Overview of the Terminal Gateway Client-to-client HTTP API and required app configuration.'
---

<Warning>
**Client-to-client mode is an involved form of integration** that requires careful network setup and management. It is designed for very specific use cases and is **not recommended for most integrations**.
</Warning>

<Info>
Client-to-client lets your POS or backend call the Terminal Gateway app over the local network to initiate payments and terminal actions.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Most integrations should use the standard Terminal API** instead of client-to-client mode. The Terminal API provides centralized terminal management, better scalability, and simplified network requirements.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure the Terminal Gateway app">
  Follow the setup in <a href="/api-reference/terminal-gateway/app-configuration">App configuration</a> to:
  - Enable Client-to-client mode
  - Note the device IP and port (default 8189)
  - Set the API key

  <Check>
  You should see the device IP on the app home screen and be able to reach `http://{IP}:{PORT}` from your network.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Client-to-client API">
  After configuration, use the API documented under Terminal Gateway to:
  - Create payments (`POST /commands/pay`)
  - Cancel payments (`POST /commands/cancel`)
  - Print receipts (`POST /commands/receipt`)
  - Run settlement (`POST /commands/settlement`)
  - Query histories (`POST /histories`)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Requests must include the correct provider header (e.g., `BRI`, `GHL`) and `X-API-KEY` set in the app.
</Tip>

## Choosing a connection mode

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Recommended: Host-to-Host (Default)">
  Host-to-Host is recommended for most integrations because it:

  - Centralizes terminal management and monitoring
  - Scales to many devices and locations
  - Simplifies network/security by avoiding direct device access
  - Reduces POS coupling to terminal networks

  <Tip>
    Use Host-to-Host unless you have a specific need for direct local access.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Client-to-Client when">
  Consider Client-to-Client **only** for these very specific use cases:

  - **Locally managed POS systems**: Your cashier/POS system runs entirely locally without a central server backend
  - **Bundled distribution**: You want to bundle your POS system with terminal devices for distribution to retail stores without any central backend system to manage distribution
  - **Offline-capable terminals**: You need terminals that can operate with intermittent connectivity, though internet access is still required for payment processing

  <Warning>
    Client-to-Client **still requires internet connectivity** to process payments and communicate with terminal device providers. It only removes the need for your POS to connect to a central server - the terminals and gateway app or SDK themselves must still have internet access.
  </Warning>

  <Warning>
    This integration requires managing local network configuration, firewall rules, and direct IP/port access between your POS and terminal devices. You are responsible for ensuring secure network communication.
