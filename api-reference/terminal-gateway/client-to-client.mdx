description: 'Overview of the Terminal Gateway Client-to-client HTTP API and required app configuration.'
---

<Info>
Client-to-client lets your POS or backend call the Terminal Gateway app over the local network to initiate payments and terminal actions.
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure the Terminal Gateway app">
  Follow the setup in <a href="/api-reference/terminal-gateway/app-configuration">App configuration</a> to:
  - Enable Client-to-client mode
  - Note the device IP and port (default 8189)
  - Set the API key

  <Check>
  You should see the device IP on the app home screen and be able to reach `http://{IP}:{PORT}` from your network.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Client-to-client API">
  After configuration, use the API documented under Terminal Gateway to:
  - Create payments (`POST /commands/pay`)
  - Cancel payments (`POST /commands/cancel`)
  - Print receipts (`POST /commands/receipt`)
  - Run settlement (`POST /commands/settlement`)
  - Query histories (`POST /histories`)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Requests must include the correct provider header (e.g., `BRI`, `GHL`) and `X-API-KEY` set in the app.
</Tip>

## Choosing a connection mode

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Recommended: Host-to-Host (Default)">
  Host-to-Host is recommended for most integrations because it:

  - Centralizes terminal management and monitoring
  - Scales to many devices and locations
  - Simplifies network/security by avoiding direct device access
  - Reduces POS coupling to terminal networks

  <Tip>
    Use Host-to-Host unless you have a specific need for direct local access.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Client-to-Client when">
  Choose Client-to-Client for localized integrations that require:

  - Direct LAN access from POS to the terminal device
  - Low-latency, on-premise communication without cloud routing
  - Operation in restricted networks without outbound connectivity
  - Temporary fallback if the central service is unreachable

  <Warning>
    Client-to-Client requires that your POS can reach the terminal IP/port on the same network and that you manage local network/firewall rules securely.
  </Warning>
