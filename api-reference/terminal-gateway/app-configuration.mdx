  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/app/transaction-timeout-settings.png" alt="Gateway app settings screen showing the Transaction Timeout option under Network" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Card and QR timeouts">
  - Card Timeout (minutes) — maximum time the terminal has to complete a card transaction before the app auto-cancels and retries the transaction.  
  - QR Timeout (minutes) — maximum time for QR transactions before the app auto-cancels and retries the transaction.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click **Save Changes** to apply the new timeouts.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Device Status Monitoring

Each device in the terminal list displays a status indicator that changes color based on its current state. Monitor these indicators to ensure your terminal fleet is operating correctly.

### Status Indicators

| Status | Color | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Unreachable/Offline | Red | EDC terminal is unreachable or offline due to incorrect <a href="#finding-terminal-information">IP address</a>, network issues, or missing EDC configuration |
| Processing | Yellow | A transaction is currently in progress on the EDC terminal |
| Online | Green | EDC terminal is online, connected, and ready for transactions |
| Disabled | Grey | EDC terminal is disabled and not available for transactions |

### Troubleshooting Status Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Red Status - Terminal Unreachable/Offline">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows red status indicating it cannot be reached or is offline.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the terminal <a href="#finding-terminal-information">IP address</a> is correct and accessible
- Check network connectivity between the app and terminal
- Ensure the terminal is powered on and properly configured
- Verify firewall settings aren't blocking the connection

    <Warning>
  Red status terminals cannot process transactions and require immediate attention.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Grey Status - Terminal Disabled">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows grey status indicating it's disabled.

**Solutions**:

- Check if the terminal has been manually disabled in the app
- Verify terminal configuration and settings
- Restart the terminal connection if needed
- Contact support if the issue persists

    <Note>
  Disabled terminals are intentionally unavailable and won't process transactions.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Yellow Status - Terminal Processing">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows yellow status indicating a transaction is in progress or appears stuck.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the terminal and POS are properly connected to the network
- Check if the current transaction is still awaiting card input or PIN
- Confirm whether the POS has already received a callback/response
- Review app logs for timeouts or error messages during processing

    <Tip>
  Yellow status is normal while a transaction is actively processing.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Green Status - Terminal Online">
  **Context**: Terminal shows green status indicating it is online and ready.

**What this means**:

- The device is connected and reachable by the app
- No transaction is currently in progress
- The terminal can accept new commands

**If you still encounter issues**:

- Confirm the POS is sending commands to the correct terminal
- Verify API credentials and environment (test vs production)
- Check recent logs for command errors or rejected requests

  <Check>
  Green status indicates the terminal is healthy and ready to use.
  </Check>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Monitor device status indicators regularly to ensure your terminal fleet is
  operating correctly. Red or grey statuses may require immediate attention.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Unresponsive EDC Machine">
  **Problem**: The EDC (Electronic Data Capture) machine becomes unresponsive or stops processing transactions.

  **Solution**: 
  1. Restart the EDC machine by holding the power button and selecting "Restart"
  2. Wait for the device to fully boot up and reconnect
  3. Verify the terminal is back online using the connection monitoring features

  <Warning>
  Always ensure the EDC is properly restarted before attempting new transactions to avoid data corruption.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Kiosk Mode Configuration">
  **Problem**: Unexpected behaviors or unauthorized access to terminal functions.

  **Solution**:
  1. Ensure all transactions are initiated only through the app
  2. Contact the Xendit EDC team to enable POS-only mode for your <a href="#finding-terminal-information">Terminal IDs</a>
  3. Configure terminal settings to disable manual transaction entry

  <Tip>
  POS-only mode prevents manual transaction entry and ensures all operations go through your application.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Response After Payment Completion">
  **Problem**: EDC fails to send transaction results to the app after payment completion.

  **Solution**:
  1. Query the Payment Session using the Terminal API to retrieve the latest status
  2. Check network connectivity between the EDC and your application
  3. Verify the callback URL configuration in your payment session
  4. Implement retry logic for failed status updates
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Stuck or Missing Callback After Receipt Printed">
  **Problem**: Transaction appears stuck or you don't receive a callback after the terminal prints a receipt, indicating the transaction may be incomplete.

  <Note>
  This troubleshooting section applies only to BRI terminals.
  </Note>

  **Solution**:
  Call the Terminal API retry endpoint <a href="/api-reference/payments-terminal-api/retry-terminal-payment-session">`/v1/terminal/sessions/{id}/retry`</a> to request the app check the transaction status and redo the transaction if it's incomplete.

  <Info>
  The retry endpoint instructs the app to verify the current transaction status with the terminal and automatically redo the transaction if it's found to be incomplete.
  </Info>

  <Tip>
  Use this retry mechanism when you see a receipt printed but haven't received a callback, as it may indicate the transaction didn't complete successfully on the terminal side.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection Issues">
  **Problem**: Unable to establish or maintain connection with terminal devices.

  **Solutions**:
  - **Check network connectivity**: Ensure both devices are on the same network
  - **Verify IP addresses**: Confirm terminal <a href="#finding-terminal-information">IP addresses</a> are correct and accessible
  - **Firewall settings**: Check if firewall is blocking the connection ports
  - **Terminal status**: Ensure the terminal is powered on and in ready state
  - **App initialization**: Verify client key and terminal configuration

  <Note>
  Use the connection monitoring features to diagnose specific connection issues.
