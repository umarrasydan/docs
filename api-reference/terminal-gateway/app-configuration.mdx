# Terminal Gateway App Configuration

The Terminal Gateway app helps developers integrate their application with Xendit supported terminal devices. Configure connection types, manage devices, and monitor terminal status through an intuitive interface.

<Info>
  This app works alongside the Terminal API to provide complete in-person
  payment functionality. You'll use the Terminal API to create payment sessions
  and this app to manage terminal device connections.

## Getting Started

Before starting, you'll need a terminal CLIENT_KEY from the Xendit In-Person Payments team and add a device.

<Warning>
  Keep your client key secure and never share it with unauthorized parties. Use
  test keys for development and production keys only for live environments.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter API Key">
When the app opens for the first time, a modal will appear. Enter your testing CLIENT_KEY in the "Test API Key" field and click "Save".
</Step>

<Step title="Add Your First Device">
  Click "+ Add Your First Device" to link a terminal device.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Device">
  Fill in Terminal ID and IP Address, and click "Add Device" button.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Connection">
The app will test the connection with the added device and run the service. The app is now accepting commands.

<Check>
Your Terminal Gateway app is now ready to accept commands from your POS system.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connection Types

The Terminal Gateway app supports two connection modes for different integration scenarios:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Host-to-Host (Default)">
  **Recommended for most use cases** - The app runs a host-to-host service that manages your terminal fleet centrally.

{' '}
<Steps>
  <Step title="Default Configuration">
    The app automatically runs in host-to-host mode when first launched.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage Terminals">
    Add and manage multiple terminal devices through the app interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Centralized Control">
    All terminal communications are handled through the app's centralized
    service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Tip>
  Host-to-host mode is ideal for managing multiple terminals and provides easier fleet management.
  </Tip>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Client-to-Client">
  **For localized integration** - Direct communication between your POS system and terminal devices.

  <Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click the 'Settings' button in the app.
  </Step>

{' '}
<Step title="Select Connection Type">
  Select the 'Connection Type' menu item.
</Step>

{' '}
<Step title="Enable Client-to-Client">
  Enable the 'Client to Client' toggle on the top-right side, and then **go
  back** to the home screen.
</Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    The **client-to-client** server is running, and now the POS can send commands directly to the Terminal device.

    <Check>
    Your app is now running in client-to-client mode for direct terminal communication.
    </Check>

  </Step>
  </Steps>

  <Info>
  Client-to-client connection provides more localized integration but requires direct network access to your terminal devices.
  </Info>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Environment Configuration

Configure the app for different environments based on your development and production needs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Test Mode (Default)">
  **For development and testing** - Use test client keys and sandbox environment.

{' '}
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    When the app opens for the first time, enter your testing CLIENT_KEY in the
    "Test API Key" field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Transactions">
    All transactions are processed in test mode and won't affect real payment
    data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Note>
  Test mode is enabled by default and uses the test environment for all transactions.
  </Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Production Mode">
  **For live environments** - Use production client keys and live payment processing.

{' '}
<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Production">
    Untoggle the "Test mode" toggle in the app settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Production Key">
    A modal will appear to input your **production** In-Person Payment
    CLIENT_KEY.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    Confirm all settings are correct before processing live transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Warning>
  Make sure you have the correct production CLIENT_KEY before switching to production mode. Test thoroughly in test mode first.
  </Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Device Status Monitoring

Each device in the terminal list displays a status indicator that changes color based on its current state. Monitor these indicators to ensure your terminal fleet is operating correctly.

### Troubleshooting Status Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Red Status - Terminal Unreachable">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows red status indicating it cannot be reached.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the terminal IP address is correct and accessible
- Check network connectivity between the app and terminal
- Ensure the terminal is powered on and properly configured
- Verify firewall settings aren't blocking the connection

  <Warning>
  Red status terminals cannot process transactions and require immediate attention.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Grey Status - Terminal Disabled">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows grey status indicating it's disabled.

**Solutions**:

- Check if the terminal has been manually disabled in the app
- Verify terminal configuration and settings
- Restart the terminal connection if needed
- Contact support if the issue persists

  <Note>
  Disabled terminals are intentionally unavailable and won't process transactions.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Yellow Status - Terminal Idle">
  **Problem**: Terminal shows yellow status but transactions aren't processing.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the terminal is properly connected to the network
- Check if there are any pending transactions or errors
- Ensure the terminal is ready to accept new transactions
- Monitor for any error messages in the app logs

  <Tip>
  Yellow status is normal when the terminal is ready and waiting for transactions.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Monitor device status indicators regularly to ensure your terminal fleet is
  operating correctly. Red or grey statuses may require immediate attention.
