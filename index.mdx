## How It Works

Xendit Terminals can be used **with or without API integration**.

### POS-Integrated Payment Terminal

In this setup, your POS system communicates directly with Xendit Payment Terminal via our API. This enables automated payment workflows where transaction amounts are sent directly from your system to the terminal.

    participant Merchant as Merchant POS System
    participant Xendit as Terminal API
    participant Gateway as Terminal Gateway
    participant Terminal as Payment Terminal EDC
    participant Customer as Customer
    participant Bank as Card Network/Bank

    Merchant->>Xendit: 1. Create payment session<br/>(amount, currency, terminal_id)
    Xendit-->>Merchant: Session created (session_id)
    
    Xendit->>Gateway: 2. Notify terminal of new session
    Gateway->>Terminal: Forward session details
    Terminal->>Customer: 3. Display payment prompt<br/>(amount to pay)
    
    Customer->>Terminal: 4. Make payment on device
    Terminal->>Bank: 5. Process payment
    Bank-->>Terminal: Payment authorized

    Terminal->>Customer: Display success & receipt
    
    Terminal->>Gateway: 6. Payment successful
    Gateway->>Xendit: Update session status
    Xendit->>Merchant: 7. Webhook notification<br/>(payment status)
```

<Steps>
<Step title="Create payment session">
Your POS system creates a payment session through Terminal API with the transaction amount and terminal details.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer completes payment">
The terminal prompts the customer to tap, insert, or swipe their payment card or scan QR code.
</Step>

<Step title="Receive real-time updates">
Your system receives payment status updates through webhooks.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete transaction">
Payment is confirmed, and you can print receipts or update your inventory system.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Standalone Payment Terminal

For merchants without a POS integration, payments can be accepted directly from the terminal by manually entering the amount on the device.

    Customer->>Terminal: 3. Make payment on device
    Terminal->>Bank: 4. Process payment
    Bank-->>Terminal: Payment authorized
    
    Terminal->>Merchant: 5. Display success
    Terminal->>Customer: Print/display receipt
    
    alt Real-time notification (some markets)
        Bank->>Xendit: 6a. Immediate transaction notification
        Note over Bank,Xendit: Transaction visible in<br/>Dashboard immediately
    else Batch settlement (T+1 or later)
        Note over Bank,Xendit: 6b. Transaction sent in batch<br/>(next business day or later)
        Bank->>Xendit: Batch file with transactions
        Note over Bank,Xendit: Transactions appear in Dashboard<br/>after batch processing
    end
    
    Note over Merchant,Xendit: Merchant can view and reconcile<br/>transactions in Xendit Dashboard
```

<Info>
**Transaction visibility varies by market**: Some markets support real-time transaction notifications to Xendit, making transactions visible in your Dashboard immediately. Other markets use batch settlement files sent T+1 or later, meaning transactions appear in your Dashboard after the batch is processed. Contact your Xendit representative to understand the notification timing for your specific market.
</Info>

## Settlement

Funds are settled into your **Xendit Balance** within **T+2 days** after the transaction settlement is completed on the device.

You can view all in-person transactions and settlements from your **Xendit Dashboard**, alongside your online payments, for a unified reconciliation experience.

## Integration Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin integration, ensure you have:

- **Terminal API key** from the Xendit In-Person Payment team (for API authentication)
- **Terminal Gateway client key** from the Xendit In-Person Payment team (for SDK/app initialization)
- Terminal Gateway set up (desktop app or Android/iOS SDK)
- A terminal with Terminal ID and network connectivity
- Your environment base URL:
  - Development: `https://terminal-dev.xendit.co`
  - Production: `https://terminal.xendit.co`

<Info>
**Two different keys**: The Terminal API uses an `API_KEY` for authentication, while the Terminal Gateway SDK/app uses a `CLIENT_KEY` for initialization. Contact the Xendit In-Person Payment team to obtain both keys.
</Info>

<Warning>
Terminal API uses HTTP Basic Auth with your Terminal API key as the username and an empty password. Always include a trailing colon when constructing the header.
</Warning>

## Payment Terminal Solutions

Xendit's Payment Terminal consists of two main components that work together:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Terminal API"
    icon="terminal"
    href="/api-reference/terminal-api/introduction"
  >
    Create and manage payment sessions for in-person transactions. Handles payment processing, callbacks, and transaction management.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Terminal Gateway"
    icon="globe"
    href="/api-reference/terminal-gateway/introduction"
  >
    Connect and manage physical terminal devices. Available as desktop app and mobile SDKs for Android and iOS.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration Workflow

1. **Create a session** with Terminal API for an amount, currency, and terminal.
2. **Execute on device** through Terminal Gateway; the customer taps/inserts/swipes.
3. **Receive callbacks** for real-time status updates.
4. **Query details** for reconciliation or show receipts.

<Info>
**Don't have a physical terminal yet?** Start with our comprehensive [quickstart guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) which includes detailed simulation testing options that let you build and test your integration immediately without hardware.
