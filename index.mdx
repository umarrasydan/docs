Xendit Payment Terminal provides comprehensive in-person payment solutions for businesses using physical terminal devices. Process secure payments through Terminal API and manage terminal devices using Terminal Gateway across Android, iOS, and desktop platforms.

<Info>
**New to Xendit's Payment Terminal?** Start with our [quickstart guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) to get your first terminal payment processed in under 10 minutes.
</Info>

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Terminal API key** from the Xendit In-Person Payment team (for API authentication)
- **Terminal Gateway client key** from the Xendit In-Person Payment team (for SDK/app initialization)
- Terminal Gateway set up (desktop app or Android/iOS SDK)
- A terminal with Terminal ID and network connectivity
- Your environment base URL:
  - Development: `https://terminal-dev.xendit.co`
  - Production: `https://terminal.xendit.co`

<Info>
**Two different keys**: The Terminal API uses an `API_KEY` for authentication, while the Terminal Gateway SDK/app uses a `CLIENT_KEY` for initialization. Contact the Xendit In-Person Payment team to obtain both keys.
</Info>

<Warning>
Terminal API uses HTTP Basic Auth with your Terminal API key as the username and an empty password. Always include a trailing colon when constructing the header.
</Warning>

4. **Query details** for reconciliation or show receipts.
